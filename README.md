# Snake!

This is the game that we all love (or loved), Snake! Snake? Snaaaaaaaaaaaake?
This game works in console (no GUI) as practice for OOP principles. This game is implemented using C++.

# How to run
Just download the rep, open the solution file (.sln), then build and run! Simple as that!

# How to play
Kept you waiting, huh?
The game is simple! You move using Arrow(Right,Left,Up,Down). The snake's head is marked by 'X' while the rest of it's body is marked with 'O'. You can eat Apples, marked by '*' which increases your length! You also die if you hit the boundaries, or if you hit yourself. There are also traps marked by '#' that decreases your health, and you can regain a part of it by using healthy apples, marked by '+'.
